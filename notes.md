Implementation notes.
## TODO: Write about the following things
- Le funny e{n,m} which is *not* compiled as eeeee...e?e?e?....
- Le funny endianness probel with raw-utf8
- Overall algo
- Barrier tricks
- Static dispatch via enum
- No need to reset the state in a match-all

## Optimization ideas
- Outline big unicode classes, otherwise the code becomes big and cache inneficient.
