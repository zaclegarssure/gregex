- Benchmark the intepreter
- Write design doc and record results
- Change the interpreter to better match the jitted code
- Add barrier bit on bytecode
- Improve the perfromances of match-all-captures
- Glushkov
- raw-utf8
- raw-byte
- Named capture groups, probably put some group info on the regex
